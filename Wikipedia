Development Model: Wikipedia is a collaborative online encyclopedia. It’s like a big book that anyone can write. People from all over the world write and edit articles for free. They do this in their free time because they want to share knowledge with others. It’s like a team effort to create a giant book.

Licensing: Wikipedia uses a special license called “Creative Commons.” This license says that anyone can use, share, and even change the information on Wikipedia. But they have to give credit to the people who wrote it. It’s like sharing a recipe but telling everyone who came up with it.

Mode of Funding: Wikipedia asks people for money to keep running. They have a donation drive where people give small amounts of money. This helps pay for servers and other costs. It’s like a donation jar in a store to keep it open.

Commercial/Non-Commercial Use: Wikipedia is mostly for non-commercial use. This means you can’t use Wikipedia to make money directly. You can’t sell the articles, for example. But you can use the information for school, research, or personal use. It’s like borrowing a book from the library to learn, not to sell.

So, Wikipedia is like a big, free book created by volunteers, using a special license, funded by donations, and meant for learning and sharing, not for making money.
